# CS 131 Fall 2023: Project Starter

Hey there! This is a repository that contains the code for [CS 131](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/fall-23-website/)'s quarter-long project: making an interpreter. The project specs are as follows:

1. [Project #1 Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgPjCH_LtEA-e-SJhtB0hDKn6tMk5YNBcAyhAwFJehc/edit#heading=h.63zoibjlqvny)

This folder contains the necessary bootstrapping code:

- `intbase.py`, the base class and enum definitions for the interpreter
- `brewparse.py`, which contains the `parse_program` function to parse Brewin programs
- `brewlex.py`, which contains helper functions for brewparse.py
